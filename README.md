> 👋🏻 Hey! I'm **Luca**!  

I'm a 22-year-old **Full-stack** Web Developer from The Netherlands, currently working as a **Front-end Developer at [ROX](https://rox.nl)**.  

I'm passionate about building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I focus on **React** and **Next.js**, along with trying out tools from the modern web ecosystem.

I’m result-driven, creative, and always looking for ways to improve my code and the products I build.
