> üëãüèª Hey! My name is Luca Kuiper!

I am a 21 year old _student_ full-stack web developer from The Netherlands. I am currently in my second year of my degree in software development at **Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam**. My favorite way to present myself as a developer is someone that's result-driven, problem solving, creative and always looking for new ways to improve myself and my work.

I work with a variety of technologies, but my main focus is on **React**, using **Next.js** as my meta framework and implementing all the useful libraries the ecosystem has to offer.

If you would like to view my work, you can find it on my [website](https://infs.world). If you would like to reach me, you can do so by submitting an [contact form](https://infs.world/contact) or sending me an email at [luca@infs.world](mailto:luca@infs.world)‚ù§Ô∏è
