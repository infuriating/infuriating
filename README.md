> 👋🏻 Hey! I'm **Luca Kuiper**!  

I am a 22-year-old *student* full-stack web developer from The Netherlands.  
I am currently in my final year of my degree in Software Development at **Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam**, and working as an intern at [ROX](https://rox.nl).  

As a developer, I thrive on being result-driven, problem-solving, and creative—constantly seeking new ways to improve both my skills and the quality of my work.  

I work with a variety of technologies, with my main focus on **React** and **Next.js** as my preferred meta-framework, integrating all sorts of libraries within the ecosystem.

If you would like to view my work, you can find it on my [website](https://infs.world).  
If you would like to reach me, you can do so by submitting a [contact form](https://infs.world/contact) or sending me an email at [luca@infs.world](mailto:luca@infs.world) ❤️
