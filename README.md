> 👋🏻 Hey! My name is Luca Kuiper!

I am a 20 year old _student_ full-stack web developer from The Netherlands. I am currently in my second year of my associate degree in software development at **Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam**. My favorite way to present myself as a developer is someone that's result-driven, problem solving, creative and always looking for new ways to improve myself and my work.

I work with a variety of technologies, but my main focus is on **React**, using **Next.js** as my meta framework and implementing all the useful libraries the ecosystem has to offer.

If you would like to view my work, you can find it on my [website](infs.world). If you would like to contact me, you can do so by sending me an email at [luca@infs.world](mailto:luca@infs.world) ❤️
