> üëãüèª Hey! I'm **Luca Kuiper**!  

I am a 22-year-old *student* full-stack web developer from The Netherlands.  
I am currently in my final year of my degree in Software Development at **Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam**, and working as an intern at [ROX](https://rox.nl).  

My favorite way to present myself as a developer is someone who is result-driven, problem-solving, creative, and always looking for new ways to improve myself and my work.  

I work with a variety of technologies, but my main focus is on **React**, using **Next.js** as my go-to meta-framework and implementing all the useful libraries the ecosystem has to offer.  

If you would like to view my work, you can find it on my [website](https://infs.world).  
If you would like to reach me, you can do so by submitting a [contact form](https://infs.world/contact) or sending me an email at [luca@infs.world](mailto:luca@infs.world) ‚ù§Ô∏è
